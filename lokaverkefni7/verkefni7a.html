            Each of it's mini-games are unique, fun, and utterly hilarious. 
            Even after playing many, many rounds it's still fresh and exciting. 
            In addition, Fall Guys' in-game currencies can be 
            earned easily from playing, rather than paying.

                Through a series of semi-random minigames, your goal in Fall Guys 
                is to be the last bean standing. You might have to race your opponents 
                to a finish line by navigating tricky obstacles, work with other beans 
                to snatch tails, or simply 
                outlast your fellow players on a rolling-log contraption..

        Development. The conception of what became Fall Guys began when 
        mediatonic was discussing another project in January 2018. 
        Lead designer Joe Walsh said that it reminded him of game 
        shows such as Takeshi's Castle and Total Wipeout. He drew from that 
        inspiration to create a pitch document for what would 
        become Fall Guys.
